#### How to run
Search for an artist located in the dictionary. Example: U2, Kanye West, Michael Jackson, Frank Ocean.
If you can't think of one click on the an album on the home page image. You're also able to get a random album by clicking on the random tab and see our contact information by clicking on the contact tab.

#### Future Work
Future work would include adding a remote database and creating our own API or using the spotify API to pull from. We would also like to update the frontend as well as the backend.
